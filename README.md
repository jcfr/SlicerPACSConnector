# SlicerPACSConnector

The SlicerPACSConnector is a 3D Slicer extension which offers a simple and clear interface between 3D Slicer and your local or remote PACS. 
You can chose between a simple "query" as well as "query and retrieve from PACS" including the transfer of the data to Slicers's DICOM database.
 
This extension (and Slicer) supports reading from PACS only.
